      <description>Descriptions we want to build an ’app’ which can listen to a specific &amp;lsquo;storage account&amp;rsquo;, whenever a new file has been uploaded(we take this an event), this app will be triggered to do sth based on the event.
About Event Grid Components Events - What happened, alerts,facts
Event sources - Where the event took place.
Event generator/publisher - e.g. Storage blob
Topics - One of an endpoint where publishers send events.</description>
